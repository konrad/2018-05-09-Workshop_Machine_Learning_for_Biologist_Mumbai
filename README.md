# Machine Learning for Biologists (Mumbai, 2018-05-09)

## Introduction

- A one day workshop that offers a basic introduction into Machine
  Learning methods with a focus on biological applications. In a
  practical part the participants will learn how to apply the gained
  theoretical knowledge using Python and the scikit-learn library.

## Audience

## Requirements

- Some background in Python and Jupyter notebook
- Anaconda installation (Python 3.6)

## Installation instruction

[Python](http://python.org/) is a popular language for research computing, and great for
general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its research
packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), an all-in-one installer.

Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you
install Python version 3.x (e.g., 3.6 is fine).

We will teach Python using the [Jupyter
notebook](https://jupyter.org/), a programming environment that runs
in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
Firefox browsers are all
[supported](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility)
(some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below,
are not).

### Windows

- [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQ0mzZ8UvA)

1. Open https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for Windows.
3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation except make sure to check Make Anaconda the default Python.


### macOS

- [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcSAln46u9U)

1. Open https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for OS X.
3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

### Linux

1. Open https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for Linux. (The installation requires using the shell. If you aren't comfortable doing the installation yourself stop here and request help at the workshop.)
3. Open a terminal window.
4. Type

```
    bash Anaconda3-
```

    and then press tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear. If it does not, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file, for example with:

```
    cd Downloads
```	
   Then, try again.

5. Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. To move through
   the text, press the space key. Type yes and press enter to approve
   the license. Press enter to approve the default location for the
   files. Type yes and press enter to prepend Anaconda to your PATH
   (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).

6. Close the terminal window.
